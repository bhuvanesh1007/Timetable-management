1️⃣ High-Level System Architecture
The system is divided into three major layers:

Presentation Layer (Frontend)

Provides user interfaces for Students, Faculty, and Admin.
Communicates with the backend via REST API.
Technologies: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (React.js/Vue.js/Angular).
Business Logic Layer (Backend API)

Handles authentication, timetable CRUD operations, and business rules.
Technologies: Flask/Django (Python) or Express.js (Node.js).
Data Layer (Database)

Stores user details, timetable entries, and logs.
Technologies: MySQL/PostgreSQL.

2️⃣ Modular Architecture Design
A. Student Module
View timetable for enrolled courses.
Receive notifications on timetable changes.
Access timetable via web or mobile interface.

B. Faculty Module
View class schedule assigned to them.
Submit change requests for rescheduling.
Manage attendance and course materials (if extended functionality).

C. Admin Module
Manage timetable creation, updates, and deletions.
Resolve conflicts in scheduling.
Manage user roles (add/remove students and faculty).

D. Common Services (Shared Module)
Authentication & Authorization: Secure access control for different roles.
Logging & Error Handling: Track user actions and system errors.
Notification System: Alert students and faculty of schedule changes.

3️⃣ Deployment Architecture
Development & Hosting Options
Backend API → Hosted on AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, or Heroku.
Frontend → Deployed on Netlify/Vercel for web-based access.
Database → Hosted on AWS RDS, Firebase, or PostgreSQL.
Version Control → Managed using GitHub

4️⃣ Database Design Considerations
A. Tables Required
1️⃣ User Table
Stores user details (Student, Faculty, Admin).
Attributes: user_id, name, email, role, password.
2️⃣ Timetable Table
Stores class schedules.
Attributes: id, course_name, teacher_id, day, start_time, end_time.
3️⃣ Course Table (Optional)
Stores information about courses.
Attributes: course_id, course_name, department.
4️⃣ Notification Table
Stores system notifications for timetable changes.
Attributes: notification_id, user_id, message, timestamp.
5️⃣ Security & Performance Considerations
✅ Authentication & Authorization: JWT-based authentication for secure access.
✅ Load Balancing: API Gateway to distribute requests across multiple servers.
✅ Database Indexing: To optimize timetable lookup queries.
✅ Caching Mechanism: Use Redis/Memcached for quick timetable retrieval.
